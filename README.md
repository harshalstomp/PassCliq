# PassCliq 

PassCliq beacuse everything is just a click away!

A credential fort knox's first version released.

PassCliq is an intuitive tool to generate strong passwords and preserving the credentials in the vault.

PassCliq never shares the vault with the internet.


## Objective 

I was finding a hard time to manage all my gaming and other services credentials. The sole purpose of this application was to make credential management easy. I will be using this to store all my drive, placement and gaming credentials. It is recommended to always have a backup of the vault file, so that in the case of a hard drive or OS failure the credentials are safe. Good luck using it :).
